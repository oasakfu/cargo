== The story so far... ==
Cargo needs to get to the top of a tree, but there is a beehive in the way. In
desperation, you enter the tree at the bottom and try to sneak through the hive.
Hopefully the bees are still outside.

== To start the game ==
 1. Install Blender 2.61,  either from the Blender web site or using your
    system's package manager (e.g. apt-get in Debian and Ubuntu Linux). The
    download page for Blender is: 

    http://www.blender.org/download/get-blender/
 
 2. a. Run cargo.sh (GNU/Linux)
    b. Run `blenderplayer Cargo.blend`.
    c. Start Blender, browse to Cargo.blend using the File > Open
       menu, and then choose Game > Start Game (from the menu at the top). Note
       that this option will run more slowly.

== Playing the game ==
Cargo can crawl on almost any surface, including walls and ceilings. Use the
arrow keys to move. To turn a corner, press the left or right arrow and forward
or backward - as if you were driving a car.

Cargo's shell is useful, too! Press Space to enter the shell. You can then roll
along the ground by pressing the arrow keys. The shell won't stick to walls or
the ceiling, but it can float. Are there any other uses for it?
