== Shaders ==
 - Custom shader controls are tricky; best to only have one in the scene. The
   prime example of this is grass and leaves in LoD trees: if there is an LoD
   tree in the level, it is essential that all leaf instances are controlled by
   that tree. If explicit instances are placed around the level, e.g. in
   SpiderIsle or CargoHouse, the shaders will not match the baked LoD tree.

== Materials ==
 - UV layers are determined by the texture slots. If you're using a nodal
   material, the BASE material needs to have texture slots with UV layers
   assigned if you want to use more than one layer!
